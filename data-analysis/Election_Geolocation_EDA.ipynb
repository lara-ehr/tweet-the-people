However, breaking it down into percent by ticket suggests that there isn't an enormous contrast between the two populations after all, this is just an artefact of there being slightly more Democrat than Republican tweets overall. (Could determine further statistical information concerning probability of having a location based on ticket using a logistic regression here but it doesn't seem interesting enough to warrant the extra attention.)"

    "\n",
    "In this sample, nearly one-fifth of locations were unclear; 40% of those were not assigned a correct location by `geocoder`. Overall, this results in an 8% rate of poor location information.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the flip side, that's over 90% accuracy in `geocoder`'s ability to detect a user's location!\n",

    "\n",
    "Options from various domains (which could also help impute missing location data for the users who provided none at all):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hashtag tracking:** If the tweet contains a hashtag, in which state is this hashtag most popular?\n",
    "    - Given a particular hashtag, what's the likelihood of it being tweeted from a specific state? Or at a somewhat zoomed out level, from a red or blue state (rather than the exact state)?\n",
    "    - Predict the state from hashtags?\n",
    "        - This is somewhat risky, as the model will be learning from data whose labelling is only 92% accurate.\n",
    "        - To avoid the problems with poorly annotated data: Are there enough geotagged tweets containing hashtags in order to build a  model restricted to just this data subset, and then extrapolate from there to the wider dataset?\n",
    "            - Can we augment this data set through human-annotated reference samples?\n",
    "        - Otherwise: If we accept the 8% noise factor, can we build a more robust model using all of the location data we have (from either geotagging or user profile info) and use it to extrapolate to tweets that didn't have a user location?\n",
    "        - Note: Some subset of the data that contains no location information also does not contain hashtags. How much data will be left unlabelled through this approach?\n",

    "2. **Social network clustering:** Can we interpolate a user's location from the people they follow and their locations?\n",
    "    - The dataset contains tweets from >220k unique users\n",
    "    - Steps would be:\n",
    "        - Grab user's followed accounts (Twitter API limits this to 5k followers at a time, this seems like more than enough)\n",
    "        - Get those users' locations where possible (this will have the same problem with noise in self-reported locations)\n",
    "        - Interpolation: copy location of the account that a user most frequently interacts with? Does Twitter provide this data in some summary form? If so, is the location of a high-interaction account actually a good proxy for a user's location? (Boils down to: do people interact more with people who live close to them? Probably some do and some don't.)\n",

    "Logic/assumptions for this interpolation model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The use of a hashtag in a tweet predicts that tweet's partisan lean.\n",
    "    - E.g. #StopTheSteal is a pro-Republican hashtag, #Vote is a pro-Democrat hashtag.\n",
    "2. Partisan lean predicts geolocation.\n",
    "    - Pro-Trump hashtagged tweets are likely to come from pro-Trump states.\n",
    "3. Therefore, hashtag predicts location.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Building the model:\n",
    "- Training and testing the model: I'll use the ground-truthed data that I have from the geotagged tweets. Since this is an extremely small data set, I'll augment with a fresh batch of human-annotated data.\n",
    "- Model type: LogReg classifier that predicts red state/blue state/lean red/lean blue based on hashtag feature\n",
    "- Geolocation based on user profile was over 90% accurate. If I can build a model that reaches 80% accuracy of predicting location from hashtags, I'll be happy.\n",
    "    - Lower threshold chosen because of the Poisson distribution in hashtag frequency, meaning that while some hashtags will have high degree of correlation with location (e.g. #StopTheSteal) less frequent ones will be noisier."
